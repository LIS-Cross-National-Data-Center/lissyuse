  In lissyuse.qmd I started out writing what would be the documentation file. 
  However, I guesss that the first page, the one where the webiste opens when loaded is 
always the contents of of index.qmd, there fore I have copied all the things in lissyuse.qmd and 
started out doing the correction there 

One nice repository is the follwoing 
https://crsl4.github.io/julia-workshop/
https://github.com/crsl4/julia-workshop/blob/main/_quarto.yml

Also wait a bit after commiting and pushing, to evaluate the changes in the link in 
github pages, sometimes it just takes a while .....
